## Features

- **Data Processing**: Cleans, preprocesses, and weights game data for analysis and recommendations.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests games based on user preferences using nearest neighbors and weighted attributes.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an interactive and user-friendly web application.

## Methodology

The recommendation system in PlayNext utilizes a combination of data processing techniques and machine learning methodologies to suggest relevant games.

### Data Processing
- The raw game data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and usability.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is applied to vectorize textual features such as game descriptions, tags, and genres. This technique assigns weights to words based on their importance within a document relative to the entire dataset, downplaying common words and highlighting unique ones.
- Numerical features, specifically 'game_age', are also considered.
- Both textual and numerical features are then **weighted** to control their influence on the similarity calculations. Default weights are applied as follows:
    - "tags": âˆš0.45 â‰ˆ 0.67
    - "desc": âˆš0.45 â‰ˆ 0.67
    - "game_age": âˆš0.1 â‰ˆ 0.32
- The weighted textual and numerical features are then combined into a comprehensive feature matrix in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format for efficient computation.

### Recommendation Engine
- The recommendation engine employs a **Nearest Neighbors** model with the **cosine distance** metric to find games similar to a given set of "root games" based on their combined features. Cosine distance measures the dissimilarity between two vectors, and the similarity is derived as 1 - cosine distance.
- The `get_recommendations` function takes a set of "root games" and "input games" to find recommendations for the latter based on the neighbors of the former.
- **Similarity Boosting**: After identifying the nearest neighbors, the similarity scores are further adjusted based on:
    - **User Attractiveness**: A weight (`user_attractiveness`, default 0.25) is added to the base similarity score based on the 'user_attractiveness' of the recommended games.
    - **Platform Popularity**: A weight (`platforms`, default 0.1) is applied multiplicatively if a recommended game is available on the **most popular platform** among the initially selected "input games".
- Finally, the resulting similarity scores are scaled to a range between 0 and 1.

### Key Steps
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Textual features ('detailed_description' and 'tags_combined') are transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
2. **Feature Weighting**: Weights are applied to the TF-IDF vectors and the numerical 'game_age' feature.
3. **Feature Combination**: The weighted textual and numerical features are combined into a single sparse matrix.
4. **Nearest Neighbors Search**: A Nearest Neighbors model using cosine distance is fitted on a matrix potentially including both "root games" and "input games" to find similar games.
5. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity scores are calculated from the distances obtained from the Nearest Neighbors model.
6. **Similarity Boosting**: The initial similarity scores are boosted based on 'user_attractiveness' and platform popularity.
7. **Ranking and Filtering**: The games are ranked based on their boosted similarity scores, and the top N recommendations (default 10) are selected, excluding the input games themselves.
8. **Score Scaling**: The final similarity scores are scaled to be between 0 and 1.
9. **Output**: A DataFrame containing the recommended games and their final similarity scores is returned.
